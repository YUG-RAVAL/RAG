Groundbreaking large-scale research presented at the Western Society of Allergy, Asthma Immunology Meeting in Hawaii reveals how nasal anatomy plays an important role in upper airway allergy symptoms. SAN FRANCISCO February 12, 2024 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE A groundbreaking study, presented at the Western Allergy Conference 2025 , is the first large-scale investigation to examine how nasal anatomy influences upper airway allergies using real-world data from thousands of patients . This large-scale study is the first of its kind to leverage computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling with real-world patient data, marking a paradigm shift in allergy research and advancing personalized, precision medicine. Presented by Harvard allergist Dr. Trisha Saha Ray and a multidisciplinary team of researchers, the study leverages Depth-to-Height Ratio (DHR) calculations from nasal cavity dimensions to explore their impact on allergy symptoms. The team analyzed nasal anatomy dimensions, longitudinal device usage data and allergy symptom severity across a diverse patient population, using real-time telemetry from Sonu , a drug free FDA approved Wearable and App for nasal congestion relief. The study found a clear correlation between nasal anatomy and symptom burden , suggesting that anatomical differences may predict how individuals experience and manage their allergies. This is the first time researchers have been able to study the nasal anatomy s impact on allergies at scale, said Dr. Ray . By analyzing data from thousands of patients over an extended period, we re moving closer to personalized treatment strategies for allergy sufferers worldwide. By leveraging CFD modeling and nasal anatomy data from a smartphone facial scan, researchers were able to uncover key structural factors that heighten sensitivity and increase congestion. The study was sponsored by SoundHealth and conducted in collaboration with leading institutions including Stanford University, Harvard Medical School Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the University of California, San Francisco , the findings could help guide more effective, anatomy-based treatments for allergic rhinitis and related conditions .
