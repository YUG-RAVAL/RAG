Nasal Cavity Airflow visualization in a normal breath cycle BSC-CNS CC-BY-4 SONUCheck is an innovative feature within the SONU app, allowing you to assess your nasal breathing with just subtle changes in your voice. Research shows that vocal biomarkers can indicate health conditions. Using your voice, SONUCheck creates a personalized nasal patency score a real-time indicator of how open and clear your nasal passages are. Why Clear Nasal Breathing Matters Clear nasal breathing has proven health benefits, yet nearly 50 of Americans rely on mouth breathing. Here are some of the benefits nasal breathing provides. Air Filtration Humidification : Helps reduce respiratory infections by filtering out pathogens. Sleep Quality: Improves sleep and reduces the risk of sleep apnea. Heart Health: Lowers risks of cardiovascular issues, such as hypertension. Cognitive Function: Linked to improved mental clarity and focus. For vocalists, athletes, and anyone focused on optimal breathing, SONUCheck offers feedback essential for resonance, breath control, and overall health and performance. The Science Behind SONUCheck SoundHealth worked with clinicians and speech language experts from UCSF and Weill-Cornell Medicine to develop the SONUCheck algorithm based on a rich clinical dataset. Study data included the participant s nasal anatomy (derived from CT Scans), voice recordings of nasal phrases before and after using the SONU band and patient reported nasal congestion scores. Using AI and machine learning, SONUCheck listens for vocal biomarkers of nasal blockage or restricted airflow. These biomarkers are extracted from speech metrics and spectral analysis of nasal sounds in the recorded voice samples. The technology adapts with each use, refining its accuracy and offering personalized insights as it learns from each individual s voice. How It Works Using SONUCheck is simple: 1. Record Your Voice Speak into your device, and SONUCheck captures vocal data in seconds. 2. Analyze Measure SONUCheck processes the vocal biomarkers, measuring nasal patency and identifying potential airway congestion or irregularities. 3. Real-Time Insights Results are displayed instantly, allowing you and your clinician to track respiratory health over time and even assess treatment effectiveness remotely. 4.
