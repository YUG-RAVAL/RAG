### SONUCheck Features

**Q: How do I access SONUCheck from the SONU app?**
A: Tap the mic icon in the bottom navigation bar on the SONU home screen.

**Q: Can I use SONUCheck anytime?**
A: Yes. SONUCheck is always available via the mic icon in the app.

**Q: Is the SONU band required to use SONUCheck?**
A: No, but we recommend using it for more accurate and consistent recordings. Make sure it is paired before you start.

**Q: Why is SONUCheck showing me a speech recognition accuracy error?**
A: SONUCheck implements an automatic speech recognition module that requires a certain part of the sentence to be valid. This check avoids scoring words that are not in the sentence shown on the screen. It's also possible that in loud or noisy environments, the accuracy may drop to a low level causing this error.

**Q: Why is my score low even though I feel congested?**
A: The app assesses nasal airflow based on sounds like "m" and "n." You may still produce these sounds clearly despite feeling congested. SONUCheck also improves over time by learning from your data.

**Q: Is SONUCheck free?**
A: Yes, it's completely free.

**Q: How do I start and stop voice recording?**
A: Tap the Start button to begin recording. After reading the sentence, tap Stop to end the recording.

**Q: Does SONUCheck work in all environments?**
A: Use it in a quiet space. Background noise can affect scoring accuracy.

A: Ensure the band is fully charged using the provided USB-C cable. Press and hold the button under the band fabric until the green light flashes.

**Q: How do I reset the band?**
A: Charge the band to 80%. Then press and hold the button for 30 seconds. Release the button after you hear a beep. The band will enter pairing mode.

**Q: Why does it say 'facial recognition' is not supported when I try to log into my account?**
A: This is a settings feature in your iPhone. In your iPhone 'settings' go to the SONU app and turn on 'Face ID.'

**Q: What if my SONU band isn't pairing with my phone?**
A: In your phone's 'settings' go to Bluetooth and ensure your SONU band is discovered and try to connect it from here. Watch video
