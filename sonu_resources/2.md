**Description:** Acoustic Resonance Therapy Acoustic resonance happens when sound waves cause an object or system to vibrate at its natural frequency. This natural frequency of vibration denotes the maximal energy transfer in and out of the object. Every object or space has its own natural frequency, which is the rate at which it vibra

Sound Evidence Sonu is FDA-Approved Pediatric Therapy for Drug-Free Nasal Congestion Relief Our most recent clinical study in children and teenagers aged 12 to 21 showed that a Sonu significantly reduces chronic nasal congestion and the total set of nasal symptoms associated with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, with no side effects. Acoustic Resonance therapy has been shown to be safe and as effective if not more than intranasal steroids. SONU is clinically proven to be as effective as steroid sprays with ZERO side effects for children ages 12 and adults. Data in preparation for publication. Nathan et al. Annals of Allergy, Asthma Immunology, 2008; 100(5):497-505. Study includes mixed population of pediatric patients over age 12 and adults. Click here to view the FDA approval. The Science behind Acoustic Resonance Therapy Acoustic resonance happens when sound waves cause an object or system to vibrate at its natural frequency. This natural frequency of vibration denotes the maximal energy transfer in and out of the object. Every object or space has its own natural frequency, which is the rate at which it vibrates. When sound waves with the same frequency as an object s natural frequency hit the object, the vibrations grow stronger, creating resonance. Your browser does not support the video tag. When you blow across the top of a bottle, the air inside begins to vibrate, producing sound through a phenomenon known as resonance. This occurs only at the bottle s specific resonant frequency a natural pitch determined by the bottle s shape, size, and the amount of air it contains. At this frequency, the air column vibrates most strongly. At other frequencies, as seen in the video, there s little to no air movement. Our sinuses function much like these bottles. They re air-filled cavities that, like musical instruments, can resonate and modulate sound. Sonu s bone conduction system, placed on the forehead, acts like a miniature tuning fork, stimulating the sinuses to vibrate at their unique resonant frequencies. This targeted vibration moves the air within the sinuses, delivering optimal vibrational energy to the nasal cavity helping reduce inflammation and clear mucus. The SONU app uses a face scan to determine each person s unique resonant frequencies, allowing it to personalize acoustic resonance therapy for truly individualized relief. The key to how the SONU Band works lies in the science of acoustic resonance. When sound waves match the natural frequency of an object, like the sinus cavities, they cause stronger vibrations. The SONU Band sends these resonant sound waves through bone conduction from your forehead to your sinus cavities. These vibrations help loosen mucus and reduce swelling, making it easier to breathe. This method uses the body s natural response to sound vibrations to effectively clear congestion.
