Personalized Treatment for Nasal Congestion The SONU band emits resonant sound waves that relieve nasal congestion by reducing inflammation, increasing mucociliary clearance, and opening up the nasal airways. These sound waves are generated by the SONU app which uses a smartphone facial scan combined with advanced ML ( Machine Learning) technology to generate a personalized 3D facial map and calculate the user s optimal sino-nasal resonant frequencies. 3D facial map CT scan of sino-nasal cavities The SONU wearable band delivers this acoustic therapy in convenient, at-home treatment sessions to relieve nasal congestion caused by both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. The Science Behind SONU The SONU band sound waves (that are specifically tuned to each person s unique facial geometry) gently vibrate the sinus and nasal cavities. The sound energy has the effect of soothing or down regulating certain autonomic nerves in the back of the nose and the forehead area above the eyes, sending signals to calm nasal congestion. At the same time, the vibrations help stimulate nerves in the nose to trigger vasoconstriction, reducing swelling and opening up the nasal passages. These sound waves also promote mucociliary clearance, or the natural sweeping action inside the nose tissue which aids in draining healthy mucus. The vibrations also help dilute dense, accumulated mucus through sonication, or breaking up the mucus into smaller particles The science is also backed up by rigorous research. In a clinical trial, 80 of SONU patients felt a dramatic improvement in their nasal congestion. ( Research )

**Description:** Acoustic Resonance Therapy Acoustic resonance happens when sound waves cause an object or system to vibrate at its natural frequency. This natural frequency of vibration denotes the maximal energy transfer in and out of the object. Every object or space has its own natural frequency, which is the rate at which it vibra

**Content:**

Sound Evidence Sonu is FDA-Approved Pediatric Therapy for Drug-Free Nasal Congestion Relief Our most recent clinical study in children and teenagers aged 12 to 21 showed that a Sonu significantly reduces chronic nasal congestion and the total set of nasal symptoms associated with allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, with no side effects. Acoustic Resonance therapy has been shown to be safe and as effective if not more than intranasal steroids. SONU is clinically proven to be as effective as steroid sprays with ZERO side effects for children ages 12 and adults. Data in preparation for publication. Nathan et al. Annals of Allergy, Asthma Immunology, 2008; 100(5):497-505. Study includes mixed population of pediatric patients over age 12 and adults. Click here to view the FDA approval. The Science behind Acoustic Resonance Therapy Acoustic resonance happens when sound waves cause an object or system to vibrate at its natural frequency. This natural frequency of vibration denotes the maximal energy transfer in and out of the object. Every object or space has its own natural frequency, which is the rate at which it vibrates. When sound waves with the same frequency as an object s natural frequency hit the object, the vibrations grow stronger, creating resonance. Your browser does not support the video tag. When you blow across the top of a bottle, the air inside begins to vibrate, producing sound through a phenomenon known as resonance. This occurs only at the bottle s specific resonant frequency a natural pitch determined by the bottle s shape, size, and the amount of air it contains. At this frequency, the air column vibrates most strongly. At other frequencies, as seen in the video, there s little to no air movement. Our sinuses function much like these bottles. They re air-filled cavities that, like musical instruments, can resonate and modulate sound. Sonu s bone conduction system, placed on the forehead, acts like a miniature tuning fork, stimulating the sinuses to vibrate at their unique resonant frequencies. This targeted vibration moves the air within the sinuses, delivering optimal vibrational energy to the nasal cavity helping reduce inflammation and clear mucus. The SONU app uses a face scan to determine each person s unique resonant frequencies, allowing it to personalize acoustic resonance therapy for truly individualized relief. The key to how the SONU Band works lies in the science of acoustic resonance. When sound waves match the natural frequency of an object, like the sinus cavities, they cause stronger vibrations. The SONU Band sends these resonant sound waves through bone conduction from your forehead to your sinus cavities. These vibrations help loosen mucus and reduce swelling, making it easier to breathe. This method uses the body s natural response to sound vibrations to effectively clear congestion.

SONUCast Personalized Allergy Forecast Tool SONUCast is your go-to tool for managing allergies, built right into the SONU app. It provides a real-time, personalized allergy forecast , so you can plan your day without the surprise of allergy symptoms just like checking the weather. Model of airflow through the nasal passages NIDCD grantee Kai Zhao, Ph.D., Ohio State University (NIDCD grant RO1DC013626), and Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Media and Public Relations Every person s nose is unique! Why does this matter? The shape and size of your nasal cavity play a big role in how allergies affect you. When the nasal passages are shaped a certain way, it can change how air flows and how allergens, like pollen, settle in your nose. At SoundHealth, we research and apply advanced technology to better understand and address nasal congestion and allergy symptoms. We use smartphone facial scans combined with machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately predict the structure of the nasal passage. Our research data is the most comprehensive of its type, including patient-reported nasal congestion scores, geo-tagged to show the pollen levels in the air when the patient s CT scan was taken, based on hundreds of individuals. We then used all of this rich data to develop a machine-learning model trained on a combination of CT scans, facial recognition landmarks, symptom reports, and geo-tagged pollen data. This model helps us explore the relationship between nasal anatomy and allergy symptoms. Our findings suggest that certain nasal structures are more prone to trapping pollen, leading to more severe congestion and other allergy symptoms. By using a large dataset that considers factors like temperature, humidity, and various pollutants in the air, we can predict which individuals are more likely to experience worse symptoms based on their anatomy and environmental conditions. This data is what powers SONUCast . Study Details: Researchers compared detailed CT (x-ray) scans of nasal cavities to their smart phone facial scans. They used these scans to measure specific anatomical landmarks of each person s nasal cavity and then calculated their dimensions. They compared these numbers and usage data from hundreds of SONU app users to predict allergy symptoms based on anatomy and real time pollen levels. CT scan of sino-nasal cavities 3D facial map What They Discovered: The results showed that nasal anatomy played a significant role in severity of allergy symptoms like nasal congestion and higher risk predictions were associated with 33 higher usage of the SONU band, especially during high pollen seasons. Data Driven Results: Enter SONUCast This study highlights the importance of the sino-nasal anatomy in understanding how allergies affect different people. SONUCast uses a patient s nasal dimensions as part of its patented AI technology to analyze your facial anatomy and geographic location. The app scans your face using your smartphone camera and applies advanced algorithms to predict how allergens will affect you based on local air quality, pollen levels, and your individual sinus and nasal structures. With this rich, personalized data, SONUCast helps you stay ahead of allergy attacks. Optional: Pair with the SONU Band If you own the SONU Band , the world s first FDA-approved device for treating allergic rhinitis, SONUCast works in sync with it.

It features a unique machine learning approach that quantifies nasal breathing in real time and provides a personalized score in the free and easy-to-use SONU app. SONUCheck will be available in the SONU app for general download on Nov. 19. Studies have shown that over 50 of Americans identify as mouth breathers. This prevalence highlights the need for increased awareness about the importance of nasal breathing for overall health and well-being. Mouth breathing has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems, including hypertension and sleep apnea. It negatively affects the respiratory system, introducing unfiltered and poorly humidified air into the lungs, which leads to respiratory infections and inflammation. SONUCheck breaks new ground by empowering everyone to become aware and quantify their nasal breathing in real time. Nasal breathing is critical for performance. Nasal breathing offers numerous health benefits, including improved oxygen uptake, enhanced nitric oxide production, and better filtration of airborne particles. Nasal breathing is critical for proper facial development, dental health, and cognitive function, said Dr. Jayakar Nayak, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Otolaryngology at Stanford Otolaryngology Head Neck Surgery. For vocal performers, nasal clarity is imperative as it supports resonance, breath control, and overall vocal quality. The SONU app is a game changer as it brings performers and speech language therapists an essential tool to easily assess nasal breathing. The SONUCheck feature combined with the FDA-approved SONU band gives performers a full suite of tools to take performance to a new level without the side effects of nasal sprays or rinses, said Dr. Anais Rameau, Chief of Dysphagia, Sean Parker Institute for the Voice; Weill Cornell Medicine Director of New Technologies, Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery. The SONU app leverages AI and machine learning to analyze and report a nasal breathing score, based on spectral properties and speech metrics of the recorded voice sample. SoundHealth s unique AI-enabled scoring algorithm, validated by clinical data, continually improves with new voice samples, providing an innovative, accessible way to monitor nasal breathing.

Stanford Medicine and SoundHealth collaborate on innovative approach to insomnia treatment PALO ALTO, Calif. Oct. 15, 2024 A groundbreaking study from researchers at Stanford Medicine and SoundHealth presents a new, non-invasive therapy for chronic insomnia using customized binaural spatial audio delivered via an acoustic resonance therapy (ART) headband. Chronic insomnia, which affects 10 to 15 of the adult population, often leads to reduced quality of life and is associated with multiple health risks, including cardiovascular disease and depression. The study involved 20 participants diagnosed with moderate-to-severe insomnia, who were treated using personalized acoustic resonance therapy. By utilizing the SoundHealth SONU headband in conjunction with a special smartphone-based app Sonu-Sleep that integrates facial scanning and machine learning, personalized binaural audio tracks were created to match each participant s unique cranio-facial resonance frequencies. Key findings After four weeks of treatment, nearly half of the participants (45 ) achieved an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score below 7, indicating a clinically significant resolution of insomnia. Participants experienced an average reduction of 11.3 points on the ISI scale, demonstrating the treatment s effectiveness. Adherence to the protocol was 100 , with no adverse effects reported. This is an exciting step forward in non-pharmacological insomnia treatment, said Dr. Kevin Lin, M.D., Stanford Medicine, the co-author and lead researcher of the study. These initial results are encouraging, showing potential for acoustic resonance therapy as a non-invasive, safe adjunctive treatment for insomnia. It is important to recognize that it should be part of a comprehensive approach, including sleep-related behavioral improvement, and further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and broader applicability, however, this early data is remarkable, and we look forward to deepening our understanding of this innovative approach, said Robson Capasso M.D., FAASM, Chief of Sleep Surgery, Professor of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery and by courtesy of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University Future directions The promising results of this pilot study pave the way for larger trials to confirm the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of this therapy. The research team also aims to explore additional applications of acoustic resonance therapy in treating other sleep disorders. This project was supported by SoundHealth Systems, which provided the SONU devices, and the Stanford School of Medicine. The study was presented at SLEEP Europe the 27th Congress of the European Sleep Research Society in Seville, Spain on September 27, 2024.

SONUCast uses cutting-edge AI to predict nasal allergies based on the dimensions of a person s nasal cavity and sinuses, enabling allergy sufferers to get ahead of an attack SAN FRANCISCO Sept. 17, 2024 SoundHealth , Inc . ( SoundHealth ), a medical technology company harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and medical science to improve patient outcomes, today introduced the first-ever personalized allergy forecast based on a person s facial anatomy and their surrounding environment. The SoundHealth SONU app uses patented AI algorithms to scan a user s face and produce a real-time, personalized forecast of their allergy symptoms based on their location. SONUCast uses air quality data along with nasal anatomy and the physics of particle aerodynamics to warn the user of an impending allergy attack. SONUCast is unique in that it is paired with the world s first FDA-approved wearable to treat symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea (runny nose) and nasal itching, which occur when airborne particles are deposited in the nasal cavity. SoundHealth s proprietary AI ML algorithms can estimate internal sinonasal dimensions to within 5 of a CT-scan, and enables real-time computational modeling and the ability to predict an individual s nasal allergies. Once a user scans their face, they can simply select a location anywhere in the world, and SONUCast instantly provides them with a personalized allergy forecast. SONUCast s AI has been trained on data from thousands of human subjects and hundreds of CT scans, making it the first-ever AI to be used for allergy forecasting as well as for acoustic resonance therapy (ART). AI powers the FDA-approved SONU band to deliver a non-pharmaceutical ART treatment with no known side effects for rhinitis that is on par or better than nasal corticosteroids. SONUCast empowers patients to get ahead of their allergies, said Dr. Paramesh Gopi, founder and CEO, SoundHealth. Existing apps use an imprecise, one-size-fits-all approach. Our breakthrough AI and deep clinical science personalize predictions based on an individual s facial structure and are poised to transform patient care by empowering patients to take control of their allergies. With the SONU band and SONUCast, SoundHealth enables patients to potentially avoid allergy attacks with therapy that is FDA-approved and as effective as nasal steroids for the treatment of rhinitis. Jayakar Nayak, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Otolaryngology at Stanford Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery, added, Understanding the intricate relationship between facial and nasal anatomy is crucial to appreciate how allergy and congestion symptoms can both manifest. The unique structures within the nose and sinuses, from the turbinates to the septum, not only determine airflow but also influence how allergens are filtered and how congestion is experienced. Our nasal anatomy is the silent architect of respiratory health in many individuals, and can dictate how we respond to environmental triggers. SoundHealth s SONUCast represents a major step forward for patients as it can empower them to more effectively predict and therefore manage their nasal allergies. The data and clinical science behind SONUCast are quite groundbreaking, and may set a new standard for both prediction and treatment of nasal congestion due to allergies.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a De Novo classification for the SONU product, which includes the SONU device and the SONU app. 7 million seed round funding for marketing and expanded indications In parallel with the official launch of SONU, SoundHealth received 7 million of seed-round funding. SoundHealth will use the funds to enhance the commercialization and marketing of SONU and to seek regulatory authorization for additional indications for pediatric use and insomnia. Moai Capital and J4 Ventures led the round with additional funding from TeleSoft Partners, Tau Ventures, TechU Ventures and Rhythm Venture Capital. Peter Moran, an early-stage investor in digital health and wellness companies, a former long-time managing partner at DCM Ventures, and a seed investor in SoundHealth, will join the SoundHealth board of directors. The investor syndicate has a long track record of successful investments in groundbreaking solutions from both enterprise and health tech startups. We are delighted to announce the close of our seed-round investment the proceeds of which will be used for product launch and advancing our pipeline of indications for the SONU device. Our groundbreaking technology provides the first FDA authorized, non-pharmaceutical medical device treatment option for nasal congestion due to allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. SoundHealth s mission is to provide personalized, intelligent wearables to help people breathe and sleep better! said Dr. Paramesh Gopi, founder and CEO, SoundHealth. SONU is using the latest medical science to provide a game-changing and liberating alternative treatment for nasal congestion. Investors are increasingly looking for high-efficacy solutions to many maladies without the side effects of pharmaceutical approaches. I look forward to working with SoundHealth s tenured team in helping many people find relief from nasal congestion with this simple yet powerful, non-invasive device without the side effects often associated with pharmaceuticals, said Moran. We were especially struck by how quick and easy SONU can bring relief to allergies, without using a drug. Future applications could include helping with sleep and stress, said Amit Garg, managing partner of Tau Ventures. SONU provides acoustic resonance therapy for nasal congestion SONU is an AI-enabled patented drug-free medical device that uses acoustic vibrational energy to provide personalized relief for nasal congestion. Acoustic vibration associated with humming has been shown to decrease symptoms of nasal congestion, possibly through modulation of autonomic inputs to the nasal mucosa or through nitric oxide activity, which may in turn exert a decongestant and anti-inflammatory effect on the nasal passages. Yogic breathing exercises that incorporate humming have been practiced for centuries and have recently been demonstrated clinically to reduce symptoms of chronic sinusitis including nasal congestion. Published research and panel discussion on acoustic resonance therapy at American Rhinologic Society s Summer Sinus Symposium An article presenting the results of a SoundHealth-sponsored clinical trial of acoustic resonance therapy, published by the International Forum of Allergy Rhinology, is available here . In addition to co-authoring the article, SoundHealth founder and Head of Research Dr. Peter Hwang, MD, FARS, participated in a panel, Acoustic Energy and Vibration Therapy of the Sinonasal Cavity, on July 12, 2024 at the American Rhinologic Society s 13th Annual Summer Sinus Symposium . Attendees learned the principles, practical applications, devices and techniques of optimizing treatment for rhinitis using acoustic energy and vibration therapy. The American Rhinologic Society (ARS) is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians, which includes attending the Summer Sinus Symposium. SONU s vibroacoustic therapy offers an innovative drug-free treatment option for my patients suffering from allergic and non-allergic nasal congestion. The prospect of replacing medications with a scientifically proven non-invasive therapy is truly exciting, said Dr. Cecelia Damask, DO, FAOCO-HNS, FAAOA, a physician at Orlando and Lake Mary ENT Allergy, board-member-at-large for the American Osteopathic Colleges of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AOCOO-HNS), coordinator of education for the American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy (AAOA), chair-elect of the Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Committee for the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and assistant professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. SONU is a really interesting technology. It s based on the really old understanding that when we hum or sing or whistle, our sinuses open, and we also feel very relaxed. The vibration relaxes the sympathetic and parasympathetic parts of our autonomic nervous system; it opens our sinuses with resonance, improves the flow of mucus in the nose and promotes ciliary action. SONU was designed based on what we know about vibrations and acoustic resonance, without any medications, and the patient can do whatever else they want while using the SONU band. We ve waited a long time in our field for a product that can help manage nasal congestion, sinus pressure and tension in the head and neck in such an elegant way, so that the whole experience is wonderful for our patients. It s a very good alternative to the other options of medications, allergy management, surgery and office procedures. So, I m excited to add SONU to the toolkit for patients with nasal congestion, said Dr. Jacob Johnson, MD, president, San Francisco Audiology, ENT specialist, San Francisco Otolaryngology Medical Group, and associate clinical professor, University of California, San Francisco. SONU uses AI for personalized therapy based on patients unique anatomy SONU is easy, convenient and pleasant to use for patients. Using SoundHealth s proprietary AI technology, the SONU app scans their face using a smartphone, creates a digital map of their sinuses and calculates their optimal resonant frequencies. Following the initial one-time scan, the patient simply places the SONU band around their head, turns it on and the SONU band delivers frequencies tailored to the patient based on the app s calculations. Symptom relief begins in minutes. Patients do not need to change their activities while using SONU. They can enjoy SONU anytime at home just for 15 minutes twice a day, for example, while online, brushing their teeth, drinking their morning coffee, exercising or watching TV. The SONU band produces resonant sound waves that gently vibrate the nasal cavity. These micro vibrations are so small they may not even be noticeable, and they stimulate nasal nerves, which may result in vasoconstriction, which reduces swelling and opens nasal passages; sonication, which dilutes accumulated dense mucus; and mucociliary clearance, which drains healthy mucus. SONU represents a brand-new category of safe and rapid relief therapies for nasal congestion, and spares patients from the side effects commonly associated with pharmaceutical treatment options.
